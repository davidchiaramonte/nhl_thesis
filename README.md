# NHL Thesis Reflections


Things I learned/skills I developed:
1. Customer empathy!
2. Utilization of Looker for not just LookML, but custom SQL as well.
3. Liquid HTML
4. No limitations on data exploration besides your imagination! :)
5. `label_from_parameter`

Challenges I faced:
1. Normalized data
2. Looking at the data in several ways

FRs I +1'd:
1. Resize columns in table visualizations

Things I would've worked on with more time:
1. HTML for each team's colorways
2. Custom hockey rink visualization

# Huge shoutout to Peter W and Molly for the mentorship and help!
